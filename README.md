# SI-unit-relations
Code for generating diagrams of metrological dependence in the old and new SI units. Created for "What are the proposed realizations in the New SI for the kilogram, ampere, kelvin and mole?" at  http://physics.stackexchange.com/q/147433/8563, and "Proposed redefinition of SI base units" at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_redefinition_of_SI_base_units.

This repository includes the images for the old and new SI, the Mathematica notebook used to generate them, and a printout of said notebook.
